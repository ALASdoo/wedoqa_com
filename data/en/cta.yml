  title: 'The WeDoQA Difference'
  content: |
    You have countless options of PM and QA providers to choose from, so you might be wondering what sets WeDoQA apart from the crowd. For starters, we pride ourselves in our Communication, Precision, Reliability, Consumer Privacy, and Uncompromised Quality.

    Our team is comprised of tenured and trained industry experts who remain on the cutting edge of all industry developments. While we test for technical specs and compliance, we seek out non-IT input during weekly brainstorming sessions with everyday users who test your software. The insights they deliver take your project to the next level, ensuring an intuitive, user-friendly, and valuable product. This is where we really shine!

    We understand that project plans change which is why we can test or take over project management at every stage of the development cycle. We can start from scratch or jump in when you hit a rough patch. With our dedication to clear communication we know the questions to ask to hit the ground running.

    We work with start-ups on their proprietary software and apps, provide third-party testing for developers, help established corporations elevate their project outcomes, and consult and test any type of software to ensure quality, compliance, function, and positive user-experience.

    Last but certainly not least, we have an in-house Selenium framework which we discuss the benefits of below.
